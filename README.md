### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- Hello, my name is Dylan!
- I'm currently working towards my Associates Degree in Computer Science at BlueRidge Community College (BRCC for short).
- I am looking to expand my knowledge beyond the basics/intro to Python and JavaScript.
- Iâ€™m looking for help with lists, arrays, and just small bit of help with Inheritance and Polymorphism
- About me: I'm working towards my associates in CS at BRCC, I hope to tranfer to Virginia Tech as I have heard nothing but amazing things from their CS program and job success rate after graduating. On what little down time i have between classes and work i spend my time practicing code and looking at different languages as well. Beyond that I am out with friends or at home playing video games.
- How to reach me: You may reach me at my email Dyllan.deavers@gmail.com (my real name is spelled with one l and my email is spelled with two).
- Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm always tired.
